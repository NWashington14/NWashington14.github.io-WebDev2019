<P>RedvsBlue is a funny, emational, and sometimes sad but watch .
 <Br>The show have awesome acting and story telling even for animation.</p>
 
<Br>In RedvsBlue about two teams fight each other but as episode gose on they find out that the war is over so team up trying to 
<Br>figure out what to do.But somehow they alwas get trouble like fight super soldier, going back in time ,stopping time, cloens super soldiers.
<Br>Sometimes a friends gose away and you can never see them again. But you what RedvsBlue taught me to say goodbey but don't. I know not everbody
<Br>like same thing so but these speeches change my point of view to say goodbey.
